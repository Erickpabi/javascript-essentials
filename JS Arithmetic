Basic arithmetic operators :
+ addititon
-  subtraction
*   multiplication
%    modulus
/     division
**   exponentiation
++  increment
--  decrement

Operator precedence
Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses
