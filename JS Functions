A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific function.
Eg; function myFunction(){
alert("Hello world");
}

myFunction();

The myFunction on line 6 invokes the function. A function is also called subroutine or procedure in other languages and it can contain parameters.

eg:function myFunction(a,b){
return a*b;
}

myFunction(4,3);

parameters have been passed onto the function which is a and b. And  the one which is used to invoke the function has 4,3 as argument passed onto the parameters
