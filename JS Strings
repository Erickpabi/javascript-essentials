A string is used for storing and manipulating text.
String can be written in single or double quotes. Eg: "John" or 'John';

Eg:"We are 'Vikings' from the North";

Strings can be made objects.
Eg: var x = new String ("John");

To make it an  object, we use the word "new";

To compare two strings , we use the == or === operator.

The == operator compares only the values but the === compares both the type and value.

Eg:
var x= "John";
var y= new String("John");

x==y is true 

but x===y is false

String objects can never be compared whether using the double equals operator or triple equals operator
