Events is something the browser does or the user does.
Eg: button onclick events.

Example of events to change a text to the current date and time;

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date()">Click to find out </button>

<p id="demo">What is the date and time ?</p>

</body>
</html>


There are types of events a user can perform . Examples are:
onchange --	An HTML element has been changed
onclick 	--The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover --	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout --	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown 	--The user pushes a keyboard key
onload --	The browser has finished loading the page
